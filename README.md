# SQL REAL WORLD BUSINESS REPORT PROJECT - SQL

For this project, I practiced my SQL knowledge using the PostgreSQL framework. The project used a DVD rental business database to create a report that summarized sales volume categorized by movie genre to help stakeholders determine which genres of films are most profitable.  This was designed to help them with inventory control, marketing, and infrastructure design.  

I created a user-defined function that performed a transformation on the payment_date field, a query that extracted the raw data for the detailed table, a trigger statement on the detailed table that continually updated the summary table, and a stored procedure that refreshed data in both tables.

This project helped me to practice my knowledge of relational databases, SQL, and PostgreSQL.  I developed a summary table and a detailed table that pulled data from the rental database, which I manipulated to show relevant data.
